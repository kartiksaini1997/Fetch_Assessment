Hello Team,

We have established a structured relational data model as part of our continuous investigation to better organize our information across three major areas: Users, Receipts, and Brands. This methodology increases the efficiency of our queries and allows us to provide more precise answers to crucial business concerns.

I completed an initial study to establish our top five brands based on the number of receipts scanned in the most recent month. This data is critical for analyzing client behavior and optimizing our strategy.

Furthermore, as part of our commitment to data quality and integrity, we have begun reviewing the data for any problems. Our initial inspections concentrated on discovering missing or conflicting data across all tables. Additional inspection and repair activities will be undertaken to guarantee that we are working with the most accurate data available.

As our data study progresses, I will be available to offer additional in-depth observations. Please let me know if you have any particular inquiries or areas of interest you would want us to explore.

Best Regards
Kartik Saini
